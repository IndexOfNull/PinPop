Here lie the CAD and 3D printing files for my pin clutch grabber. I created this in 2022 after a long night of rearranging pins (my fingers hurt quite badly). To make my life easier, I modeled this plier-like, keycap-puller inspired tool!

Because I modeled this in Fusion 360, the provided .f3d file is what I would recommend downloading (if you have Fusion). Otherwise, you can import the .step file into your CAD software of choice. If you just want to 3D print it, a .3mf file is provided.
