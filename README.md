Here lie the CAD and 3D printing files for my pin clutch grabber. I created this in 2022 after a long night of rearranging pins (my fingers hurt quite badly). To make my life easier, I modeled this plier-like, keycap-puller inspired tool!

If you use Fusion 360, the provided .f3d file is what I would recommend downloading (make sure you have the Visitor TT1 BRK font installed so the text doesn't break). You can import the .step file into your CAD software of choice. If you just want to 3D print it, a .3mf file is provided.
